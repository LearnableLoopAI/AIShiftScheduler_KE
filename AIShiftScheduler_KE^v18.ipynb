However, instead of the CRISP-DM'S \"4 Modeling\" section, we inserted the \"6 step modeling process\" of [Dr. Warren Powell](https://castlelab.princeton.edu/people/) in section 4 of this document. Dr Powell's universal framework shows great promise for unifying the formalisms of at least a dozen different fields. Using his framework enables easier access to thinking patterns in these other fields that might be beneficial and informative to the sequential decision problem at hand. Traditionally, this kind of problem would be approached from the *reinforcement learning* perspective.
